Create the GitHub account with your Geneseo email.\n\nGo to GitHub.\nClick ‚ÄúSign up for GitHub‚Äù.\n\n\nChoose your GitHub username carefully:\n\nhttps://USERNAME.github.io will be the address for your website.\nByeong-Hak‚Äôs GitHub username is bcdanl, so that Byeong-Hak owns the web address https://bcdanl.github.io.\n\nIt is recommended to have a username with all lower cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling git if you do not have one.\nStep 2.\n\nCheck whether git is installed in your laptop.\n\n\nFrom the Console Pane in RStudio, click Terminal tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Terminal, run the following command to check if your laptop has git installed.\n\ngit --version\n\nIf your computer has git installed, you will see the message below and you do not need to install git:\n\ngit version 2.xx\n\nIf your computer does not have git installed, you will see the message below and you need to install git:\n\n'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command\n\n\nInstall git if you do not have one. Move to the next step if you have git installed in your laptop.\n\n\n\n\nMac\n\nGo to http://git-scm.com/downloads, and download the file.\nClick ‚ÄúmacOS‚Äù, scroll down the webpage, and then click ‚Äúinstaller‚Äù from the Binary installer section.\nRun the downloaded file.\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\nGo to https://gitforwindows.org, and download the file.\nRun the downloaded file.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep clicking ‚ÄúNext‚Äù to complete the installation of git.\nAfter the git installation is done, close RStudio and re-open it.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up GitHub Credential on your local Git.\nStep 3. In Terminal, run the following commands one by one:\ngit config --global user.email \"YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS\"\ngit config --global user.name \"YOUR_USERNAME\"\nFor example, the email address for my GitHub account is bchoe@geneseo.edu, and my GitHub username is bcdanl, so that I ran below:\ngit config --global user.email \"bchoe@geneseo.edu\"\ngit config --global user.name \"bcdanl\"\n\nStep 4. Obtain a personal access token (PAT) from GitHub.\n\nIn RStudio Console, run the followings line by line:\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nThen, click ‚ÄúGenerate token‚Äù in the pop-upped web browser.\nWe can think of GitHub‚Äôs personal access token as a password that expires. You can decide how long it remains valid. My recommendation is to set its expiration for May 31, 2024, or later.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, copy the generated PAT, and paste it to your clipboard or R script.\n\n\nStep 5. Set the GitHub credential using the PAT.\n\nIn RStudio Console, run the followings line by line:\n\ninstall.packages(\"gitcreds\")\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nYou will be asked to provide your PAT.\nPaste your PAT to the RStudio Console, and then hit Enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nIt does not harm to create multiple PAT for one GitHub account.\nAfter the PAT expires, you should repeat the following if you want to update your GitHub website:\n\n\nCreate a new PAT:\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nReplace the current PAT with the new PAT:\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nSelect the option 2: Replace these credentials by typing 2 and hitting Enter on R Console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishing the Connection between GitHub repo and your local Git\nStep 6. Login to your GitHib and make the repository.\n\nFrom https://github.com, click the plus [+] icon in the upper right corner and select ‚ÄúNew repository‚Äù.\nName this repo USERNAME.github.io, which will be the domain for your website.\n\n\ne.g., If your GitHub username is abc9, the name of your repo should be abc9.github.io, not abc_9.github.io.\n\n\nThen, copy the web address of your GitHub repo, https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io\n\n\nFor example, the web address for Byeong-Hak‚Äôs GitHub repo is https://github.com/bcdanl/bcdanl.github.io.\n\n\nStep 7. Create a RStudio project with Version Control\n\n\n\n\nClick ‚ÄúProject (None)‚Äù at the top-right corner in RStudio.\nClick ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù &gt; ‚ÄúVersion Control‚Äù &gt; ‚ÄúGit‚Äù\nPaste the web address of your GitHub repo to the Repository URL menu.\nClick ‚ÄúBrowse‚Äù to select the parent directory for your local project directory (I recommend ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù folder.)\nClick ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf Step 7 does not work on your laptop, try below Steps 7-1 and 7-2 instead. If Step 7 DOES work well, skip Steps 7-1 and 7-2.\n\n\nStep 7-1. Use git clone to establish the connection between GitHub repo and your local laptop:\n\nChange directory to ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù in Terminal using cd command.\n\ncd &lt;pathname of \"Documents\" directory&gt;\n\nHere, you need to know the pathname of ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù directory.\nFor example, LAPTOP_USERNAME below is not your GitHub username but one for your local laptop.\n\nMac\ncd /Users/LAPTOP_USERNAME/Documents\nWindows\ncd C:/Users/LAPTOP_USERNAME/Documents\n\nUse git clone to creates a local copy of the GitHub Repository.\n\ngit clone &lt;repository-url&gt;\n\nFor example,\n\ngit clone https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io\n\nStep 7-2. Create a RStudio project from Existing Directory\n\nClick ‚ÄúProject (None)‚Äù at the top-right corner in RStudio.\nClick ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù &gt; ‚ÄúExisting Directory‚Äù\nClick ‚ÄúBrowse‚Äù to select the local copy of the GitHub Repository\nClick ‚ÄúCreate Project‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nDownloading Website Template Files\nStep 8. Download the files of website template:\n\nGo to the following webpage: https://github.com/bcdanl/danl-website-template\nFrom the webpage above, click the green icon &lt; &gt; Code, and then click ‚ÄúDownload Zip‚Äù\nExtract the Zip file you have downloaded\nIf there are the files, .gitignore, .DS_Store, or *.Rproj, in the folder, delete all of them.\nMove all the files that were compressed in the Zip file to your local project directory, USERNAME.github.io.\n\n\nSelect all the files in the danl-website-template folder (Tip: Ctrl + A (Windows) / command + A (Mac) selects all files in a directory).\nThen, Ctrl + C (Windows) / command + C (Mac) to copy them.\nThen, go to your local project directory USERNAME.github.io.\nThen, Ctrl + V (Windows) / command + V (Mac) to paste them to your local project directory USERNAME.github.io.\n\n\nRemove the danl-website-template directory from your local project directory, if you have one.\n\n\nAll the website files should be located at the same level with the R Project file (USERNAME.github.io.Rproj), shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPushing the Website Files to the GitHub repository\n\n\n\nStep 8. Push the files to your GitHub repository\n\nOn Terminal within RStudio, execute the following 3-step git commands, which will stage, commit, and push all the files in the local working directory to your GitHub repository:\n\n\ngit add . adds changes in your local working directory (e.g., edited files, new files, deleted files) to the staging area, which is a temporary area where you can prepare your next commit\n\ngit add .\n\ngit commit -m \"...\" records the changes in the staging area as a new snapshot in the local working directory, along with a message describing the changes.\n\ngit commit -m \"any message to describe the changes\"\n\ngit push -u origin main uploads the local changes to the online repository in GitHub.\n\ngit push -u origin main\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf git push -u origin main gives error, try the following:\ngit push -u origin master\n\nThe name of the default branch in a GitHub repo is usually main, but sometimes GitHub gives master default branch instead.\n\n\n\n\nStep 9. Check whether the files are well uploaded.\n\nGo to the webpages of your GitHub repository and your website:\n\nhttps://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io.git\nhttps://USERNAME.github.io\nRefresh the webpages (Ctrl + R for Windows users; cmd + R for Mac users)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReuse¬© 2024 Byeong-Hak Choe | This post is licensed under &lt;a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/' target='_blank'&gt;CC BY-NC-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;.CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nChoe, Byeong-Hak. 2023. ‚ÄúClasswork 2.‚Äù January 30, 2023."
