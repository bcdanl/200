## Instructor
### Economics, Data Science, and Climate Change

- Choe, B.H. and Ore-Monago, T., 2024. "Governance and Climate Finance in the Developing World"

- **Climate finance** refers to the financial resources allocated for mitigating and adapting to climate change, including support for initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate impacts.
  - We focus on transnational financing that rich countries provide poor countries with financial resources, in order to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
  - Since the GHG emissions in developing countries are rapidly growing, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of climate finance.
  - Poor governance can be significant barriers to emissions reductions within these countries.

## Syllabus
### Grading



- You are allowed up to 5 absences without penalty. 
  - Send me an email if you have standard excused reasons (illness, family emergency, transportation problems, etc.).


::: {.incremental}

- For each absence beyond the initial five, there will be a deduction of 1% from the Total Percentage Grade.

- Participation in discussions will be evaluated by quantity and quality of discussions in the GitHub-based discussion boards. 

- The single lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the total homework score. 
  - Each homework except for the homework with the lowest score accounts for 20% of the total homework score.

::: 
  

## Syllabus
### Grading


- The total exam score is the maximum between 
  1. the simple average of the midterm exam score and the final exam score and
  2. the weighted average of them with one-fourth weight on the midterm exam score and three-third weight on the final exam score:

$$
\begin{align}
&(\text{Total Exam Score}) \\
=\, &\text{max}\,\left\{0.50\times(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \,+\, 0.50\times(\text{Final Exam Score})\right.,\notag\\ 
&\qquad\;\,\left.0.25\times(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Final Exam Score})\right\}.\notag
\end{align}
$$



## Syllabus
### Make-up Policy

-  Make-up exams will not be given unless you have either a medically verified excuse or an absence excused by the University.

::: {.incremental}

- If you cannot take exams because of religious obligations, notify me by email at least two weeks in advance so that an alternative exam time may be set.

- A missed exam without an excused absence earns a grade of zero.

- Late submissions for homework assignment will be accepted with a penalty. 

- A zero will be recorded for a missed assignment.

## Why Data Analytics?

::: {.incremental}

- Fill in the gaps left by traditional business and economics classes.
  - Practical skills that will benefit your future career.
  - Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.

- Data analytics skills are largely distinct from (and complementary to) the core quantitative works familiar to business undergrads.
  - Data visualization, cleaning and wrangling; databases; machine learning; etc.

- In short, we will cover things that I wish someone had taught me when I was undergraduate.

## The State of the Art
### Generative AI and ChatGPT

- **Generative AI** refers to a category of artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of generating new content, ranging from text, images, and videos to music and code. 

:::{.incremental}

- In the early 2020s, advances in transformer-based deep neural networks enabled a number of generative AI systems notable for accepting natural language prompts as input.
  - These include large language model (LLM) chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard, and LLaMA.

- **ChatGPT** (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. 
  - By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.

:::



## The State of the Art
### Generative AI and ChatGPT

  
- Users around the world have explored how to best utilize GPT for writing essays and programming codes.


::::{.incremental}

:::{}
- Is AI a threat to data analytics?
  - Fundamental understanding of the subject matter is still crucial for effectively utilizing AI's capabilities.
:::

:::{}
- If you use Generative AI such as ChatGPT, please try to understand what ChatGPT gives you.
  - Copying and pasting it without any understanding harms your learning opportunity.

## What is Git?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
![](lec_figs/git-version.png)
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

$\quad$

- **Git** is the most popular **version control** tool for any software development.
  - It tracks changes in a series of snapshots of the project, allowing developers to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and merge different versions. 
  - It is the industry standard and ubiquitous for coding collaboration.
  
:::

::::

## What is Git?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](lec_figs/git-simple.png)

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

```{.bash}
git add .
git commit -m "any message is here"
git push -u origin main
```

$\quad$


::: {.incremental}
- Git operates primarily through command-line tools (e.g., **Terminal**) and is local to a user's computer.

  - It has a steep learning curve.

  
- We will not do *git collaboration* but use only the 3-step git commands on Terminal to update a website.

:::
:::

:::: 


## What is GitHub?

- [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"} is a web-based hosting platform for Git repositories to store, manage, and share code. 

::: {.incremental}

- Your personal website will be hosted on a GitHub repository.

- Course contents will be posted not only in Brightspace but also in our GitHub repositories ("repos") and websites.

- Github is useful for many reasons, but the main reason is how user friendly it makes uploading and sharing code.

:::


## What is R?

- **R** is a programming language and software environment designed for statistical computing and graphics. 

- R has become a major tool in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization. 
  - It is widely used among statisticians and data scientists for developing statistical software and performing data analysis. 
  - R is open source and freely available. 


## What is RStudio?

:::{.incremental}
- **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 
  - An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities (e.g., text code editor, graphical user interface (GUI)) to computer programmers for software development. 

- RStudio is a user-friendly interface that makes using R easier and more interactive. 
  - It provides a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management.
  - It integrates well with Git.

### R Packages and `tidyverse`

- **R packages** are collections of R functions, compiled code, and data that are combined in a structured format.


:::{.incremental}

- The `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 
  - The `tidyverse` packages work harmoniously together to make data manipulation, exploration, and visualization more.
  - We will use several R packages from `tidyverse` throughout the course. (e.g., `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`)
