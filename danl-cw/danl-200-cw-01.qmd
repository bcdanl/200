## Practice Problems
- Do the following tasks:
  1. Download the file `nbc_show.zip` from [Brightspace](https://mylearning.suny.edu/d2l/home/1234666).
  2. Extract the file `nbc_show.zip`.
  4. Copy the pathname of `nbc_show.csv` 
  5. Type the following on an R script:
  
```{r}
#| eval: false
pathname <- "PATHNAME_OF_nbc_show.csv"
```

- For example, in Byeong-Hak's computer, `/Users/bchoe/My Drive/suny-geneseo/teaching-materials/lecture-data/nbc_show.csv` is the pathname of `nbc_show.csv`.

  7. In your R script, locate your mouse cursor on any part of the line with `pathname` by clicking the line or using arrow keys.
  8. Hit **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows users) / **command + Enter** (Mac users) to run the line of code.
  6. Save an R script to Documents folder or a new directory for the course.
    - If you use a new directory for the course, I recommend you to use the name without any space. For example, do not use name like `DANL 200`. Instead, use `DANL200` for the working directory.
  
- Let Byeong-Hak know if you have issues with the tasks!
